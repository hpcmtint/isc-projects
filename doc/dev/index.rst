Stork Developer's Guide
#######################

Stork is an open source monitoring application and dashboard for
ISC's Kea DHCP, and eventually for ISC's BIND 9. It is the spiritual
successor of the earlier projects Kittiwake and Anterius.

This is the developer's guide for Stork version |release| and is aimed at Stork
developers, external contributors, and anyone who wants to understand the
internal operation of Stork. Programming background is assumed.

For the user's guide, see the `Stork Administrator Reference Manual`. Links to the
most up-to-date version of the Stork ARM document, along with other documents
for Stork, can be found on ISC's `Stork project homepage
<https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork>`_ or at `Read the Docs
<https://stork.readthedocs.io>`_ .
