Demo
====

Test change

A demo installation of ``Stork`` can be used to demonstrate ``Stork``
capabilities but can be used for its development as well.

The demo installation uses `Docker` and `Docker Compose` to set up all
`Stork` services. It contains:

- Stork Server
- Stork Agent with Kea DHCPv4
- Stork Agent with Kea DHCPv6
- Stork Agent with Kea HA-1 (high availability server 1)
- Stork Agent with Kea HA-2 (high availability server 2)
- Stork Agent with BIND 9
- Stork DHCP Traffic Simulator
- Stork DNS Traffic Simulator
- PostgreSQL database
- Prometheus & Grafana

These services allow observation of many Stork features.

Requirements
------------

Running the ``Stork Demo`` requires the same dependencies as building
Stork, which is described in the :ref:`installation_sources` chapter.

Besides the standard dependencies, the ``Stork Demo`` requires:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

For details, please see the Stork wiki
https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork/wikis/Development-Environment.

Installation Steps
------------------

The following command retrieves all required software (go, goswagger,
nodejs, Angular dependencies, etc.) to the local directory. No root
password is necessary. Then it prepares Docker images and starts them
up.

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake docker_up

Once the build process finishes, the Stork UI is available at
http://localhost:8080/. Use any browser to connect.

The installation procedure creates several Docker images:

- `stork_webui`: a web UI interface,
- `stork_server`: a server backend,
- `postgres`: a PostgreSQL database used by the server,
- `stork_agent-bind9`: an agent with BIND 9,
- `stork_agent-bind9-2`: a second agent with BIND 9,
- `stork_agent-kea`: an agent with a Kea DHCPv4 server,
- `stork_agent-kea6`: an agent with a Kea DHCPv6 server,
- `stork_agent-kea-ha1`: the primary Kea DHCPv4 server in High Availability mode,
- `stork_agent-kea-ha2`: the secondary Kea DHCPv4 server in High Availability mode,
- `traffic-dhcp`: a web application that can run DHCP traffic using perfdhcp,
- `traffic-dns`: a web application that can run DNS traffic using dig and flamethrower,
- `prometheus`: Prometheus, a monitoring solution (https://prometheus.io/),
- `grafana`: Grafana, a dashboard for Prometheus (https://grafana.com/)

.. note::

   The containers running the Kea and BIND 9 applications are for demo
   purposes only. They allow users to quickly start experimenting with
   Stork without having to manually deploy Kea and/or BIND 9
   instances.

The PostgreSQL database schema is automatically migrated to the latest
version required by the Stork server process.

The installation procedure assumes those images are fully under Stork
control. If there are existing images, they will be overwritten.

Premium Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to run the demo with premium features enabled in Kea
apps. It requires starting the demo with an access token to the Kea premium
repositories. Access tokens can be found on
https://cloudsmith.io/~isc/repos/kea-1-7-prv/setup/#formats-deb. The
token can be found inside this URL on that page:
``https://dl.cloudsmith.io/<access token>/isc/kea-1-7-prv/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh``.
This web page and the token are available only to ISC employees and paid customers of ISC.

.. code-block:: console

   $ rake docker_up cs_repo_access_token=<access token>


Initialization
--------------

``Stork Server`` requires some initial information:

#. Go to http://localhost:8080/machines/all
#. Add new machines (leave the default port):

   #. agent-kea
   #. agent-kea6
   #. agent-kea-ha1
   #. agent-kea-ha2
   #. agent-bind9
   #. agent-bind9-2

DHCP Traffic Simulator
----------------------

The traffic simulator allows DHCP traffic to be sent to selected
subnets pre-configured in Kea instances, with a limitation: it is
possible to send traffic to only one subnet from a given shared
network.

The traffic simulator can be found at: http://localhost:5000/

DNS Traffic Simulator
----------------------
Traffic simulator allows sending DNS traffic to selected DNS servers.

Traffic simulator can be found at: http://localhost:5001/

Prometheus
----------

The Prometheus instance is preconfigured and pulls statistics from:

- node exporters: agent-kea:9100, agent-bind9:9100, agent-bind9:9100
- kea exporters embedded in stork-agent: agent-kea:9547,
  agent-kea6:9547, agent-kea-ha1:9547, agent-kea-ha2:9547
- bind exporters embedded in stork-agent: agent-bind9:9119,
  agent-bind9-2:9119

The Prometheus web page can be found at: http://localhost:9090/

Grafana
-------

The Grafana instance is preconfigured as well. It pulls data from
Prometheus and loads dashboards from the Stork repository, in the
Grafana folder.

The Grafana web page can be found at: http://localhost:3000/
