    Secured agent-server channel. Implemented agent deployment using
    script downloaded from the server. The script installs deb/rpm
    packages with stork agent. Then the script registers current
    machine in the server performing key and certs exchange.
    There are two ways for authorizing the agent: server-token
    and agent-token based.
    Added TLS to gRPC traffic between agent and server using certs
    set up during agent registration. Added instruction on machines
    page how to install an agent.
    Added generating root CA and server certs, and generation of
    server token during server startup.
    Added API and UI for presenting and regenerating server token
    (Gitlab #205)

* 122 [func] godfryd

    Migrated command line processing in agent from jessevdk/go-flags
    to urfave/cli/v2. Thanks to this it is possible to define commands
    in command line. Previously only switches were possible in command
    line. This is a preparation for new agent command: register.

Stork 0.14.0 released on 2020-12-09.

* 121 [func] marcin

    Events received over SSE and presented on various Stork pages are
    now filtered and only the events appropriate for the current view
    are shown. Prior to this change all events were always shown.
    (Gitlab #429)

* 120 [func] marcin

    When Stork server pulls updated Kea configurations it detects those
    configurations that did not change since last update using a fast
    hashing algorithm. In case when there was no configuration change
    for a daemon, Stork skips processing subnets and/or hosts within
    this configuration. This improves efficiency of the configuration
    pull and update. In addition, when configuration change is detected,
    an event is displayed informing about such change in the web UI.
    (Gitlab #460)

* 119 [doc] tomek

    Prometheus and Grafana integration is now documented. Also, updated
    requirements section pointing out that stat_cmds hook is needed for
    Stork to show Kea statistics correctly.
    (Gitlab #433, #451)

* 118 [bug] marcin

    Prevent an issue whereby Stork server would attempt to fetch updated
    machine state while the request to add this machine is still being
    processed. This used to cause data conflict errors in the logs and
    network congestion.
    (Gitlab #446)

* 117 [build] marcin

    Upgraded Go from 1.13.5 to 1.15.5 and golangcilint from 1.21.0 to
    1.33.0.
    (Gitlab #457)

* 116 [perf] marcin

    Improved performance of connecting large Kea installation with many
    subnets to Stork. Adding subnets to the database is now much more
    efficient as it avoids extensive subnet lookups. Instead it uses
    indexing techniques.
    (Gitlab #421)

Stork 0.13.0 released on 2020-11-06.

* 115 [func] marcin

    Improved presentation of the HA server scopes. Added a help
    tip describing expected HA scopes in various cases.
    (Gitlab #387)

* 114 [bug] godfryd

    The links on the dashboard to subnets and shared networks have been

    shared network pages automatically set filtering by protocol version
    based on parameters provided in URL.
    (Gitlab #389)

* 113 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling renamed statistics from Kea. In Kea 1.8 some
    of the statistics have been renamed, e.g. total-addreses
    to total-addresses. Now Stork supports both of the cases.
    (Gitlab #413)

* 112 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling situation when IP address of Kea Control Agent has
    changed. Till now Stork was not able to detect this and was still
    communicating to the old address. Now it checks if address has
    changed and updates it in the database.
    (Gitlab #409)

* 111 [bug] marcin

    Corrected presentation of the HA state in the dashboard and
    the HA status panel in cases when HA is enabled for a server

    presented.

    (Gitlab #379)

* 94 [bug] marcin

    (Gitlab #112, #293)

* 90 [bug] marcin

    Fixed an issue with refreshing log displayed within the log viewer.
    The issue was triggered by the periodic updates of the information
    about monitored apps. As a result of the  updates the log file
    identifiers were changing which resulted in an error message
    informing that the viewed file no longer exists.
    (Gitlab #364)

    as belonging to the same shared network in the UI.
    (Gitlab #180)

* 36 [func] godfryd

    Added presenting IP addresses utilization within subnets and
    subnet statistics, e.g. a number of assigned addresses, in the UI

LEGEND
* [bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
          unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	      compatibility to fix the bug.
* [build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
* [doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
* [func]  new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	      change, which would require a bump of major version.
* [sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
          fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
 	      security patch releases.
