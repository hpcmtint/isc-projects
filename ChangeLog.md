    Documented secure communication channel between the Stork Server
    and the agents in the ARM. The new agent installation and
    registration methods were described.
    (Gitlab #486)

* 128 [func] godfryd, marcin

    Updated Stork demo setup to use new machines registration methods.
    Machines automatically request registration using the agent token
    method. Their registration can be approved in the machines view.
    (Gitlab #485)

* 127 [func] godfryd, tomek, marcin

    Secured agent-server channel part 3. Implemented agent deployment
    using script downloaded from the server. The script installs
    deb/rpm packages with stork agent. Then the script registers
    current machine in the server performing key and certs
    exchange. Enabled TLS to gRPC traffic between agent and server
    using certs that are set up during agent registration. Added
    instruction on machines page how to install an agent. Added UI for
    presenting and regenerating server token.
    (Gitlab #483)

* 126 [func] godfryd

    This is the second part of secured agent-server channel
    implementation. Added code for registering a machine in the server
    and performing key and certs exchange but it is not used fully
    yet. Added server-token and agent-token based agent
    authorizations. Added REST API for presenting and regenerating
    server token, but it is not used in UI yet. Updated content of
    reference agent.env agent config file.
    (Gitlab #481)

* 125 [func] marcin

    Assign friendly names to the apps monitored in Stork. The apps'
    names are auto-generated using the following scheme:
    [app-type]@[machine-address]%[app-unique-id], e.g.,
    kea@machine1.example.org%123. The [app-unique-id] is not appended
    to the name of the first first app of the given type on the
    particular machine. Thus, the name can be kea@machine1.example.org.
    The auto-generated apps' names are presented in the Web UI instead
    of the previously used app ID. The names are not yet editable by a
    user.
    (Gitlab #458)

* 124 [func] godfryd

    The first part of secured agent-server channel implementation.
    Added generating root CA and server keys and certs,
    and server token generation during server startup.
    (Gitlab #479)

    Corrected an issue with refreshing the events list on the page
    displaying the machine information. Previously, when switched
    to a different tab, the events list could remain stale.
    (Gitlab #463)

* 122 [func] godfryd

    Migrated command line processing in agent from jessevdk/go-flags
    to urfave/cli/v2. Thanks to this it is possible to define commands
    in command line. Previously only switches were possible in command
    line. This is a preparation for new agent command: register.
    (Gitlab #468)

Stork 0.14.0 released on 2020-12-09.

* 121 [func] marcin

    Events received over SSE and presented on various Stork pages are
    now filtered and only the events appropriate for the current view
    are shown. Prior to this change all events were always shown.
    (Gitlab #429)

* 120 [func] marcin

    When Stork server pulls updated Kea configurations it detects those
    configurations that did not change since last update using a fast
    hashing algorithm. In case when there was no configuration change
    for a daemon, Stork skips processing subnets and/or hosts within
    this configuration. This improves efficiency of the configuration
    pull and update. In addition, when configuration change is detected,
    an event is displayed informing about such change in the web UI.
    (Gitlab #460)

* 119 [doc] tomek

    Prometheus and Grafana integration is now documented. Also, updated
    requirements section pointing out that stat_cmds hook is needed for

* 117 [build] marcin

    Upgraded Go from 1.13.5 to 1.15.5 and golangcilint from 1.21.0 to
    1.33.0.
    (Gitlab #457)

* 116 [perf] marcin

    Improved performance of connecting large Kea installation with many
    subnets to Stork. Adding subnets to the database is now much more
    efficient as it avoids extensive subnet lookups. Instead it uses
    indexing techniques.
    (Gitlab #421)

Stork 0.13.0 released on 2020-11-06.

    (Gitlab #387)

* 114 [bug] godfryd

    The links on the dashboard to subnets and shared networks have been
    adjusted so they take into account DHCP version. This way subnets and
    shared network pages automatically set filtering by protocol version
    based on parameters provided in URL.
    (Gitlab #389)

* 113 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling renamed statistics from Kea. In Kea 1.8 some
    of the statistics have been renamed, e.g. total-addresses
    to total-addresses. Now Stork supports both of the cases.
    (Gitlab #413)

* 112 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling situation when IP address of Kea Control Agent has
    changed. Till now Stork was not able to detect this and was still
    communicating to the old address. Now it checks if address has
    changed and updates it in the database.
    (Gitlab #409)

* 111 [bug] marcin

    Corrected presentation of the HA state in the dashboard and
    the HA status panel in cases when HA is enabled for a server

LEGEND
* [bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
          unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
          compatibility to fix the bug.
* [build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
* [doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
* [func]  New feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
          change, which would require a bump of major version.
* [sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
          fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
          security patch releases.
* [perf]  Performance related change.
* [ui]    User Interface change.

*: Backward incompatible or operational change.
