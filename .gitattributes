# "-diff" is useful on files that do not offer any meaningful output when two
# different revisions of the file in question are diffed. For those files, the
# diff shows only "Binary files <file> and <file> differ" which saves up screen
# space. To override the "-diff" setting, and show the output as usual, the
# "git diff --text" command can be used.
#
# "merge=ours" is useful on files whose conflicts cannot be easily resolved
# directly, but rather through some other means. In case of a conflict after a
# rebase, the version from the base branch (determined by the "ours" value) is
# kept.

# Generated files are usually git-ignored, but the ones that are included in the
# repository can benefit from these two attributes. Generated files are often
# verbose and the equivalent diffs can be often found in their associated source
# files. Regenerating them is also easier than solving conflicts directly, and
# should also be safer. Run "rake --tasks gen:" to get file generation tasks.
